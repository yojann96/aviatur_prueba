## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

    ESTRUCTURA PRUEBA


Coding challenge 
Introduction to the problem 
The coding challenge is an excellent opportunity to showcase how you approach and solve a problem. Feel free to use 
any programming language. Please make sure you provide the proper test coverage and prove that your solution is complete. 
At a minimum, use the provided test data to indicate that the solution works as expected. Please provide your solution in English.

Drawing tool You're given the task of writing a simple drawing tool. In a nutshell, the program reads the input.txt, executes a 
set of commands from the file step by step, and produces output.txt. 
At this time, the functionality of the program is quite limited, but this might change in the future. At the moment, the program 
should support the following set of commands: 
C w h
L x1 y1 x2 y2 
R x1 y1 x2 y2 
B x y c 

Create Canvas: Should create a new canvas of width w and height h. 
Create Line: Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. 
Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character. 
Create Rectangle: Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and lower right corner is (x2,y2). 
Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character. 
Bucket Fill: Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The behaviour of this is the same as that of the 
"bucket fill" tool in paint programs. 
Please consider that you can only draw if a canvas has been created.
